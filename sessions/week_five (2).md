##### Week 5:
Building a Classifier
- Overview of Machine Learning
- Feature Engineering
- One hot encoding to encode categorical variables for use in a model
- Creating training and test data

Coding tasks:
 - What does the exploratory data analysis suggest about our question?
 - Build a model that will predict whether the average cost to income ratio for cancer care is above the average cost or equal to or below the average cost to income ratio.
 - To train a model, we will want to get more that just the Tennessee data. Make a copy of your notebook and then remove the `TENNESSEE` filters for the cancer, heart attack, and income data. **Be sure to use state and county for any aggregations.** 
   - You can remove the cells for creating visualizations from this new notebook
   - You will need to use the `state_abbrev.csv` file, which lists state names and their 2-character abbreviations, to map the state names in the cancer and heart attack data to their abbreviations **prior** to merging with the income data. The code for mapping will look something like this:
      ```
   state_abbrev=pd.read_csv('../data/state_abbrev.csv')  
   
   ha_costs['state']=ha_costs.state.map(state_abbrev.set_index('name')['abbrev'].to_dict())
   ```
- Create your target variable (whether cancer cost to income ratio is above or below the mean)
- What are your preictors?
    - Use `pd.get_dummies()` with your explanatory variables to encode any categorical values. Features for your model must be numeric.
     - Split the data into train and test sets.
    - Build and evaluate a logistic regression model.
 - Think about other potential features that might explain cost disparities. Can you find additional data that may improve your model? The number of healthcare providers in a county, the number of healthcare facilities in a county, unemployment rates, or the per-person-income (which can be approximated using the number of exemptions in the IRS data) are potential features. Can you think of others?
